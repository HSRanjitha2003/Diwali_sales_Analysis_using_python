1. Data Collection & Cleaning

1.1 Data Collection:
- Collected sales data from multiple sources, such as transactional databases, CRM systems, and external market data.
- Consolidated the data into a unified dataset for analysis.

1.2 Data Cleaning:
- Handling Missing Values: Identified and addressed missing data using techniques such as imputation or removal, depending on the context and significance of the missing values.
- Outliers Detection:Utilized statistical methods and visualizations (e.g., box plots) to detect and manage outliers that could skew the analysis.
- Inconsistencies Resolution: Corrected inconsistencies such as duplicate entries and formatting errors to ensure the dataset's accuracy and reliability.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

2.1 Visualization:
- Histograms:Created histograms to analyze the distribution of key variables such as sales amount and transaction frequency.
- Scatter Plots: Utilized scatter plots to explore relationships between variables, such as sales amount vs. discount offered, or sales performance by region.
- Heatmaps: Generated heatmaps to visualize correlations between different metrics, providing insights into how various factors are interrelated.

2.2 Statistical Analysis:
- Descriptive Statistics: Computed measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and percentiles to summarize the dataset and identify central tendencies and variability.
- Correlation Analysis: Analyzed correlation coefficients to understand relationships between variables and identify factors that influence sales performance.

3. Key Insights Discovered

3.1 Product Performance:
- Sales by Product Category:Evaluated sales performance across different product categories to identify which categories generate the most revenue and which ones lag.
- Trend Analysis: Identified trends in product sales over time to forecast future performance and adjust inventory or marketing strategies accordingly.

3.2 Customer Segmentation:
- Segmentation by Demographics: Segregated customers into distinct segments based on demographics such as age, gender, and purchasing behavior.
- Behavioral Patterns: Analyzed purchasing patterns within segments to understand customer preferences and habits.

3.3 Targeted Marketing:
- Personalized Campaigns: Recommended creating personalized marketing campaigns tailored to different customer segments. For instance, targeted promotions for high-value customers or special offers for specific demographic groups.
- Campaign Effectiveness: Suggested methods for tracking the effectiveness of these campaigns, such as monitoring changes in sales and customer engagement metrics.
